1.Find the duplicate records?

SELECT OrderID, COUNT(OrderID)
FROM Orders
GROUP BY OrderID
HAVING COUNT(OrderID) > 1

2.Remove the duplicate records?

SELECT DISTINCT column_name
FROM table_name;

select * FROM (select e.*,dense_rank(partition by deptno order by sal desc)rank from emp e)where rank=1;

SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM employee
GROUP BY department;


Rank: Rank function assigns a unique rank to each distinct row within the partition of a result set. If there are ties (i.e., multiple rows with the same value), they receive the same rank, and the next rank is skipped.
 For example, if two rows tie for the first position, the next rank assigned will be 3 (not 2). So, the ranks may not be consecutive numbers.
Dense Rank: Dense rank function, on the other hand, also assigns a unique rank to each distinct row within the partition of a result set, but it does not skip ranks when there are ties. It assigns consecutive ranks to distinct values, even if there are ties. For example, if two rows tie for the first position, both will be assigned rank 1, and the next rank assigned will be 2. So, the ranks are consecutive numbers without gaps.

DDL commands:
1.CREATE: Used to create a new database object such as a table, view, index, or schema.Example:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE TableName (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    ...
);
ALTER: Used to modify the structure of an existing database object.Example:
sql
Copy code
ALTER TABLE TableName
ADD column_name datatype;
DROP: Used to delete an existing database object.Example:
sql
Copy code
DROP TABLE TableName;
TRUNCATE: Used to remove all rows from a table without removing the table structure itself.Example:
sql
Copy code
TRUNCATE TABLE TableName;
RENAME: Used to rename an existing database object.Example:
sql
Copy code
RENAME TABLE old_table_name TO new_table_name;

DML Commands:
===========
In SQL, DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands are used to manipulate data stored in the database. The main DML commands are:

SELECT: Used to retrieve data from one or more tables in the database.Example:
sql
Copy code
SELECT column1, column2 FROM TableName WHERE condition;
INSERT: Used to add new rows of data into a table.Example:
sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO TableName (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);
UPDATE: Used to modify existing data in a table.Example:
sql
Copy code
UPDATE TableName SET column1 = new_value WHERE condition;
DELETE: Used to remove rows from a table.Example:
sql
Copy code
DELETE FROM TableName WHERE condition;

TCL Commands:
=======================================
In SQL, TCL (Transaction Control Language) commands are used to manage transactions within a database. Transactions are sequences of one or more SQL operations treated as a single logical unit of work. The main TCL commands are:

COMMIT: Used to permanently save the changes made in the current transaction to the database.Example:
sql
Copy code
COMMIT;
ROLLBACK: Used to undo all changes made in the current transaction since the last COMMIT or ROLLBACK.Example:
sql
Copy code
ROLLBACK;
SAVEPOINT: Used to set a named point within a transaction to which you can later roll back.Example:
sql
Copy code
SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT: Used to rollback a transaction to a named savepoint.Example:
sql
Copy code
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;
SET TRANSACTION: Used to set properties for the current transaction such as isolation level, access mode, or other transaction characteristics.Example:
sql
Copy code
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
